#### A project for the Univeristy of Haifa 

This is a project to make the pulling of Fitbit data easier and more convenient by making automizing the fetching with Google Apps Script and showing the data in one place, a Google Sheet.

## Apps Script
Apps Script is an immensely useful tool for enhancing your GSuite experience for your work. You can make yourself more efficient, make less mistakes, do things at scale by automating processes.

If you want to take an introduction course on Apps Script, then I suggest checking out [Apps Script Blastoff](https://www.benlcollins.com/apps-script-course/) by Ben Collins. It is free and helped me get started with this great tool immediately!

## Functional Programming
For this project I am practicing using Functional Programming. The way I see how this script works is a bunch of little bits coming together to produce an awesome result, a spreadsheet(s) showing Fitbit data from a day that produce automatically thanks to a set trigger.

### What is it?

> Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
-[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)

### Pure Functions

- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
- It does not cause any observable side effects
