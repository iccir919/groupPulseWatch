# Group Pulse Watch
### A project for the Univeristy of Haifa 

This is a project to make the pulling of Fitbit data easier and more convenient by making automizing the fetching with Google Apps Script and showing the data in one place, a Google Sheet.

## Apps Script
Apss Script is immensely useful tool for enhancing your GSuite experience for your work. You can make yourself more efficient, make less mistakes, do things at scale by automating processes.

If you want to take an introduction course on Apps Script, then I suggest checking out [Apps Script Blastoff](https://www.benlcollins.com/apps-script-course/) by Ben Collins. It is free and helped me get started with this great tool immediately!
